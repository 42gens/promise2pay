        <br><p>Wonderful of you to Forgive, here is a poem just for you!</p><br>

        <ul>
            <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
            <p>In the realm where numbers dance and sway,</p>
            <p>Debts cast shadows, long and gray.</p>
            <p>Yet beyond ledgers and coins that clink,</p>
            <p>There's a deeper truth, a stronger link.</p><br>
            
            <p>For in life’s grand tapestry, thread by thread,</p>
            <p>What matters most isn't what's owed or said.</p>
            <p>But the gestures of grace, the will to forgo,</p>
            <p>Releasing the debts, letting them go.</p><br>
        
            <p>To forgive a debt is to unshackle a soul,</p>
            <p>To mend a tear, to make things whole.</p>
            <p>It’s not just numbers fading to naught,</p>
            <p>But a liberation, a lesson self-taught.</p><br>
        
            <p>The weight of debt can burden a heart,</p>
            <p>Tug at dreams, tear them apart.</p>
            <p>Yet with one act, compassionate and true,</p>
            <p>The weight lifts, the skies turn blue.</p><br>
        
            <p>To release a debt is to sow a seed,</p>
            <p>Of trust, of hope, of a timeless creed.</p>
            <p>For in the garden of life’s vast expanse,</p>
            <p>Forgiveness lets both debtor and lender dance.</p><br>
        
            <p>So when ledgers beckon, stern and cold,</p>
            <p>Think of the tales of grace retold.</p>
            <p>For in forgiving debt, we more than comply,</p>
            <p>We touch the heart, we let spirits fly.</p>
            <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><br><br>
        </ul>
            <p>Let your borrower know you have forgiven the debt, send them and email:</p>

    <div class="placard3-content">
        <br><p></p><br>

        <p>In moments of need, the warmth of our close friends and family shines the brightest. 
        If you feel comfortable, consider sharing the proof of repayment within this trusted circle.
        By doing so, you open a door to heartfelt support, where those closest to you and the borrower, may offer a 
        helping hand in guiding the borrower towards fulfilling their commitment. Remember, 
        this journey is about connection and compassion, far removed from the public eye of social media. 
        Together, in this circle of trust and love, we can create a nurturing space that encourages responsibility and care."

    <div class="placard-content">
        <br><p>If you're considering pursuing a case in small claims court for a personal loan that's owed to you, the type of attorney you'd typically be looking for is a civil litigation attorney, specifically one who handles debt collection or contract disputes. However, there are a few things to consider:</p><br>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Self-representation: </strong>Small claims court is specifically designed for individuals to represent themselves without the need for an attorney. The process is generally simpler and more streamlined than other courts.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Monetary Limit: </strong>Each state has a different maximum amount you can sue for in small claims court. Be sure the amount owed to you is within the jurisdictional limit.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Cost: </strong>Hiring an attorney might cost more than the amount you're trying to recover, especially if the loan amount is on the lower end. You'll want to weigh the cost of hiring an attorney against the potential benefit.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Documentation: </strong>Make sure you have all necessary documentation such as written agreements, promissory notes, or any other evidence that proves the existence and terms of the loan.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Consultations: </strong>Even if you decide to represent yourself, you may want to consider having a consultation with an attorney to get advice on the specifics of your case. Some attorneys offer free or low-cost initial consultations.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Mediation: </strong>Some courts require or offer mediation as an alternative to a trial. This can be an informal way to resolve the dispute without going through the formal court process.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Collection: </strong>Winning in small claims court is just the first step. You will then have to collect the judgment, which can sometimes be challenging. Some attorneys specialize in judgment collection, so if you win and have difficulty collecting, you might consider hiring one.</li><br>
